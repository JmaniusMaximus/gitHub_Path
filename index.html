            <h3>About me</h3>
            <p>At the age of 16, I secured my first job as a chef. Through this role I learned the skills of co-ordinated team work through effective communication, in a high pressure envirnment. It also built the foundations of leadership through roles such as Sous Chef, having the oppertunity to work with business owners and reputable head chefs. Benefiting from their individual mentorship's and whitnessing a diverse range of leadership styles.</p>
            <br>    
            <p>At the age of 20 I moved FOH in order to refine my people skills. Learning the values of customer service and building upon the communication skills from my previous experience. I manged my own team of waiting staff, ran my own services and al the responsibilities which came with it. Developing a lighthearted but direct leadership and communication style.</p>
            <br>
            <p>During this time I built my own boat from marine plywood and fibre glass, using a method called stitch and glue. Please see my linked in or photos. In a nutshell, this motivated me to persue a passionate career in engineering. Taking a course in welding. Favouring ship/barge building. To this date I have aided the construction of over 24 canal barges. Working closely with the Cole family, founders of Colecraft, one of the most prestigious canal barge builders in the UK. Where I put into practice my attention to detail, creative probem solving and learned the legal requirements which we where to abide by.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I then secured a contract repairing rail caridges at the oldest repair depot in the UK. It is where the Queen's train and now Kings train is kept and maintained. Being trained in strict coded (welding) procedures. Before moving to Canada to do my part in helping construct the largest ship ever build on Canadian soil! Strictly trained and certified in FCAW, abiding by fierce safety regulations, high tolorence welding procedures and GDPR regulations as the role requred security clearance. PLease see my linked in for full career history. </p>
            <br>
            <p>Which brings me to my reason for persuing a career in software development. During these times I started an online shop on an app called depop. (Please see link) Which allowed me to apply all the skills which I had previously learnt, teaching me many business insites. My store stands out as having a near 2/3rds 5 star review to sales ratio. Far out performing the vast majority of the shops on the app. The shop gave me the drive to learn to code HTML, CSS and JavaScript. In order to create my own website, bots and automation tools which is what lead me to study this course.</p>

            <p>I am looking to break into the software develoment industry as a front end developer. In order to perfect the skills which I have learnt on this course. I would also like to progress into cyber security as a penetration tester. These skills will be essential for thios and compliment my creativity and work ethic. </p>
