            <h3>About me</h3>
            <p>At the age of 16, I secured my first job as a chef. In this role, I learned the skills of
                co-ordinated teamwork through effective communication, in a high-pressure
                environment. It also helped me build the foundations of leadership through roles
                such as Sous Chef, where I had the opportunity to work with business owners and
                reputable head chefs, benefiting from their individual mentorships and witnessing a
                diverse range of leadership styles.</p>
            <br>    
            <p>At the age of 20 I was appointed Front of House which helped enhance my people
                skills. I learned the value of customer service and built upon my existing
                communication skills. I managed my own team of waiting staff, ran my own services
                and all the responsibilities which came with them. I developed a lighthearted but
                professional and effective leadership and communication style.</p>
            <br>
            <p>During this period of employment, I used my spare time to explore my interest in
                engineering. I built my own boat from marine plywood and fibreglass, details of which
                are in my LinkedIn profile. This motivated me to pursue with passion, a career in
                engineering, taking a course in welding, with a focus on ship/barge building. To this
                date I have aided the construction of over 24 canal barges. Working closely with the
                Cole family, founders of Colecraft, one of the most prestigious canal barge builders
                in the UK, I put into practice not only my practical skills, but my attention to detail,
                and creative problem-solving, all within the strict parameters of strict legal standards
                and regulations.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I then secured a contract repairing rail carriages at the oldest repair depot in the UK.
                It is where the Queen's train and now King's train is kept and maintained. I was
                trained in strict coded (welding) procedures before moving to Canada to work on the
                construction of the largest naval ship ever built on Canadian soil! I was trained to the
                highest standards and certified in FCAW, abiding by strict safety regulations, high
                tolerance welding procedures and GDPR regulations as the role required security
                clearance.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Please see my LinkedIn profile for my full career history.
                I have now returned to the UK to pursue a career in software development. My
                passion for this career change was sparked when I created an online shop on an
                app called Depop last year (link). The nature of the business was to sell unique
                fashion items procured from USA, Canada to the UK market, and the store
                outperformed the vast majority of shops on the app, with a 2/3rds 5 star review to
                sales ratio. During this period, I not only gained invaluable business insights and
                commercial awareness, but also drove me to learn to code HTML, CSS and
                JavaScript in order to create my own website, bots and automation tools.</p>

        <section id="skills">
            <p>I am looking to break into the software development industry as a front-end
                developer in order to perfect the skills which I have learnt on this course. I would also
                like to progress into cyber security as a penetration tester.
                These hard skills complemented by my soft skills, creativity and work ethic, I believe
                will be a good match for those roles:</p>
